# Introduction

When i first get into bioinfomatic lab, I am totally unfamiliar with programme and code, its very hard for me to step into the bioinfomatic world. However, after collecting and reading some good books, i gragually know how to code and debug. This repository store some basic coding books, some of them are simple while others may be complicated. This books all related to CS languages and in the context of data analysis, keep learning and one day you'd be strong.
