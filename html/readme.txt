I don't think learning a website designer from book is good, just like photoshop, the best way to learn it is by following tutorials.
Books are quickly outdated, some classic books like <HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites> was last edited ten years ago, notwithstanding its good quality.
I recommand two website for HTML+CSS+JS learning :
1. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
2. https://www.w3schools.com/

by the way, the AI like chat-gpt is always the best helper when you are learning any language.
